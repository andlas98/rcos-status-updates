## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Created a test program in Django and started experimenting with it, learning more about the language as I go. Got stuck learning URLs and Views, as ubuntu would spit out syntax errors that didn't make sense. Might've been because I didn't make a virtual environment for the test project...

> Also checked out Grace's landing page code. Most of it makes sense syntax-wise, and it worked on her laptop. But as her method and my method for the test program are similar, and I'm getting syntax errors for things that look very correct, I'm suspicious as to what's wrong with my work.


## This Week's Plan

> Continue learning Django through online resources and Grace's (current project lead) splash page demo.

> Start applying what I've learned so far to the webpages.

## Anything Blocking?

> Two exams in the middle of next week (that I really need to study for!) as well as homework assignments for said classes. Also a report due in two weeks that I need to make headway in.
