## Last Week's Accomplishments (4/14/19 - 4/19/19)
> Resolved all pull request changes. 
> 
> Created wiki page detailing how to fix the "The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty" error many on the team (including myself) experienced this semester. Page is called "The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty" (https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/wiki/%22The-SECRET_KEY-setting-must-not-be-empty%22).
> 
> Fleshed out the Home page of the wiki.

> Team had their practice presentation on Tuesday. Overall, I believe we managed to convey our message well. However, I felt our slides needed work: originally I separated what we had done by one 'frontend' and one 'backend' slide, and everyone. It came off as awkward, as the team had to stare for prolonged periods of time at the screen to make sure their bullet point was next (based on my observations). I decided to redo the slides, categorizing based on function/webpage. I think this will lead to smoother transitions from function to function, and thus a better performance.
## This Week's Plan
1. Investigate Petition Django model, add a way to filter petitions
2. Present what we've worked on this semester
## Anything Blocking?
> Final presentation that was supposed to happen on Thursday (not RCOS) was moved to Monday, and the RCOS presentation is on Tuesday. Will work on filtering after the RCOS presentation.
