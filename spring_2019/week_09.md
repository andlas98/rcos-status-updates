## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Spoke to Grace about migrating data to the new website, as I mentioned on last week's update. She told me to leave it to her for privacy reasons. Afterwards, she recommended I tackled the filter-petition-by-tag functionality on the view-all petition page 
>
> Fixed bug that prevented the "Sort Petitions" dropdown box from displaying its options
## This Week's Plan
> Continue tackling the filter-petition-by-tag functionality on the view-all-petitions page 
## Anything Blocking?
> Nothing, really, other than other coursework (specifically my communication course). I should be able to make some good headway into the plan!
