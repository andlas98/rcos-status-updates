## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Not an 'accomplishment', more of a development: Realized neither my test Django application nor my branch of the Petitions project can run the server. The pages don't open at all. 

> I spoke with Grace about my issues. We worked on it to no avail.

## This Week's Plan
> Reinstall everything using instuctions directly from the websites the programs/software comes from (Django, python virtual environments, pip(?)). The README of this project was created by someone who uses Linux rather than Windows. So maybe the issue stems from there? 

> But I could run the server last semester. So I don't know if this will solve my issues...

## Anything Blocking?

> I will be tabling for an event next Friday. I'll need to buy snacks for it as well as procure some special decorations (drums, flags, etc.). The person I contacted to get me the drums still hasn't responded, so I'll have to pick them up myself from J Building.
> Some of the snacks are really ethnic, will need to go to a corner store in Albany to pick them up.

## Notes
> Exams this week put me in a very sour mood. One I felt very prepared for, only to get rocked. The other one was rocky in terms of preparation, so the outcome was expectedly rough. I really need to revamp my studying schedule.
