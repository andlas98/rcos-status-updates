Week of 3/24 - 3/30
## Last Week's Accomplishments
> about.html's conversion to Django is 99% complete! Most of the work was stripping down some of the code I had before (head element (as we're using a common CSS file), DOCTYPE! html, etc.) and letting {% block content %} and {% extends %} take care of the rest. However, most of the text in the History and Moderation tabs are just for flavor and are most likely going to be revised after I speak to Student Senate about what they want the text to read. All that's left after that is beautification, which I will focus on after I add further functionality to the all-petitions file.

> Worked with Richard on implementing the 'Create Petition' page (the version I created) with Django. Helped me realize how my method of organizing HTML element classes could be better simplified.
## This Week's Plan
> Find out through Grace on how to connect the old database of the Petitions site with the new version
## Anything Blocking?
> I have two exams next week that, too be blunt, are very critical. I don't know if I'll be able to make substantial progress till late Thursday/early, but I will discuss next steps with Grace, as mentioned previously.
## Notes
> Could not make it to RCOS on Friday/make much progress on the project this week due to my being at NSBE's National Convention in Detroit (I think my past updates said that it was in Chicago. I have a habit of mixing the two.)
