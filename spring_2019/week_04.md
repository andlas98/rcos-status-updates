## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Reinstalled django and virtualenv using Django's documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/install/) as well as a youtube video (https://youtu.be/nxOPY1eFL9A). Works like a charm on the test project!
> Used the method on my petitions branch, frontend (https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/tree/frontend) to see if anything would load. It didn't work, nothing loaded. It buffered endlessly, with no crash.

## This Week's Plan
> Upload test project and process made to complete test project on Github.
> Continue to find how to make my branch load properly.
> Fully commit to becoming the Project Manager of this project (by talking to Grace)

## Anything Blocking?
> Algorithms Homework, as well as an 8 page essay. 
> Staying focused over break.
