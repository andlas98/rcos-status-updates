## Last Week's Accomplishments
> No progress on the reinstallment task, unfortunately. This weekend will have to be the time to do it.
> Part of this is due to getting the objects for this Friday's event (Night of Rhythm). Getting food took longer than expected, and getting the drums was almost an all day affair.

## This Week's Plan
> Reinstall everything using instuctions directly from the websites the programs/software comes from (Django, python virtual environments, pip(?)). The README of this project was created by someone who uses Linux rather than Windows. So maybe the issue stems from there? 

## Anything Blocking?

> This Friday is the Night of Rhythm. As eboard member, I have to attend/participate.
> This Saturday is The Spring Business Meeting, which starts early in the morning. I don't expect to finish till into the evening, so most of that day will be gone. But I will do my best!

## Notes
> Exams grades came out; meh grades as expected. Need to keep my head up in order to reinstall!
