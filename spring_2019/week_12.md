## Last Week's Accomplishments (4/20/19 - 4/26/19)
> Team had their presentation on Tuesday. Overall, we had an excellent performance: everyone presented their contributions clearly, and we recieved some interesting feedback. Essentially, we should skip the minimum viable product and tackle bigger fish, such as the search bar. I agree with the sentiment, as even though we made a lot of progress, there are still important features that could be tackled.
> 
> Created a wiki page for future ideas of how to demarcate recognized and resolved petitions.
>
> Created a function for checking if a petition has been recognized. It crashes the system however, even after looking through the Django documentation as well as the code created by other members. Thus I commented it out.
>
> Added comments to all code created this semester, so future members can get acclimated ASAP.
## This Week's Plan
> None
## Anything Blocking?
> None
## Notes
> As this will be my last semester in RCOS as well as in RPI, I want to express my gratitude in the opportunities that RCOS has provided me. Part of me wishes that the CS curriculum would base itself off of this class, but I accept the logic put into the curriculum. Thanks to Grace Roller, whose amazing leadership and efforts inspired me to take of the role of Project Manager for RPI Petitions. Thanks to the rest of the team, who were all nothing but ambitious and extraordinarily friendly. And thank you to whoever's grading this, as I'm sure that's going to take a while. Thank you for your due diligence.
