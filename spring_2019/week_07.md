## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Discussed with Professor Turner about becoming Project Manager for this project. I've recorded notes from the conversation. In essense, as Project Manager I will:
- Need to oversee pull requests to the main branch 
- Have a 'roadmap' (list of goals), issues in the way, end-goals
- comment on ALL changes made to the code
- Consider launching a demo for the site (not now, when what we've created is ready)
- Include tutorials for new ideas/fixing issues
- Meet with WebTech/Student Gov't
> copied all the HTML files from the webpages folder on my branch (frontend2) to the 'templates' folder.
## This Week's Plan
> Speak to rest of the group about PM meeting, 
> Finish editing about page to move on to the all petitions page
## Anything Blocking?
> Will be attending NSBE's national conference in Chicago from Wednesday to next Sunday. I will try my best to commit my changes during free periods. 
## Notes
> Further complications with a ShellSource file (env_pass.sh, in my main directory) prevented me from making much progress on the about page.
