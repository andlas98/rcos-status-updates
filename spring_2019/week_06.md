## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I decided to start working on the About page as I felt it to be a bit simpler. Using the sample on the master branch, I've been editing the about page. 
## This Week's Plan
> Commit  what I've done so far later tonight (Friday, 3/15/19).
> Once I'm confident in it (which should be by the end of this weekend), I'll continue with the All Petitions page
## Anything Blocking?
> Working on my project for HACKRPI! That will take up the majority of my weekend, combined with two club meetings on Sunday
## Notes
