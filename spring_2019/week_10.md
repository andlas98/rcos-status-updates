## Last Week's Accomplishments (4/06/19 - 4/12/19)
> Created a paginator in the view-all page that cycles through multiple pages of content. This article (https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/08/03/how-to-paginate-with-django.html) helped me to achieve this.
>
> An effort was made to organize the Petitions objects by signature number, but to no avail. The current model doesn't seem to allow it at the moment. Will investigate in the coming days. 
> 
> Sent a pull request to Grace containing my new about page and paginator work. Grace responded, requesting small changes.
>
> Spoke with Jeffrey (team member) about stylizing the website. Was a fruitful/important conversation, as I feel we've been more focused on functionality than beautification. We discussed having a consistant color scheme, to which he proposed sending him the colors used on the site's wireframes.
## This Week's Plan
1. Finish the PR changes
2. Investigate Petition Django model
## Anything Blocking?
> I have a final presentation next Thursday (not RCOS), and the usual CS coursework. Should be able to complete the PR changes and get said changes merged before Tuesday's practice presentation.
