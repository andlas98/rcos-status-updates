## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Uploaded Django test project (djangoproj) to my "Portfolio" repository (https://github.com/andlas98/Portfolio). The instructions for creating said project are in a markdown file titled "Django, virtualenv".
>
> The method (aka the method I uploaded in the previous sentence) is creating strange errors in my Petitions branch. Something to do with the Secret Key (forgot to paste the exact error here, sorry). Stack Overflow isn't helping, so I've decided to trash the whole thing and clone the master branch so I can start fresh. I saved the HTML/Bootstrap files I created, so nothing of value will be lost.
>
> The master branch as well as the installment instructions for the project itself have changed dramatically (e.g. instead of virtualenv, we are now using pipenv). I reinstalled everything using those instructions and what's here so far loads fine! Since I was unwilling to get rid of my old branch, I've decided to create a new one (frontend2: https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/tree/frontend2). All subsequent edits will be done there.
>
> Messaged Grace about becoming Project Manager. No response as of this writing.
## This Week's Plan
> FINALLY start converting the 'All Petitions' page with Django syntax!
## Anything Blocking?
> Working on Algo Lab as well as FOCS Homework
