## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Came up with my initial goal for the start of the semester: "recreate" the webpages I implemented last semester using Bootstrap 4, in Django. 

> I want to be done with this by (absolute LATEST) beginning of March (worst case scenario, I'll have the entire spring break to finish it!).


## This Week's Plan

> Continue learning  Django through online resources and Grace's (current project lead) splash page demo.

> Create a test project in order to test learned Django skills

## Anything Blocking?

> General homework assignments and the weekend tempting me to do nothing. 

## Notes
