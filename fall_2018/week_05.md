## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Studyed more Django, added a bit to the main code. I did not commit these changes
> I made decided to change from backend from frontend. I made this decision after a Django study session. To be brief, I don't find the project's backend appealing. I've developed a website on my own using HTML/CSS last summer and enjoyed it thoroughly, so I'd rather apply what I learned then here. 
> Through this change, not only will I be working on a language I'm familiar with, but I'll be able to make more commits, as I'll be more confident in the code I'm pushing

## This Week's Plan
> Divide frontend tasks with Sam (frontend teammate)
> Get started on the construction of a page (if necessary)

## Anything Blocking?
> Have a DiffEq exam this Friday and Physics1 exam next Tuesday, both of which I NEED to spend a good # of hours studying for.
> Once both of those are out of the way, I'll be all in on this project!
## Notes 
> None
