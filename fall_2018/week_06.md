## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Starting making website files using HTML and Bootstrap. So far, so good! Wanted to start small, so I worked on the About page. It  isn't done yet, and I don't plan on finishing it until the brunt of the task (the All Petitions page) is completed. Unfortunately, I have yet to commit any of this to Github, as I'm unsure as to how to do that.

## This Week's Plan
> Go to Wednesday's bonus session, learn to commit my code to a repository branch.
>
> Delve more into the creation of the 'All Petitions' page, find how to connect info from the database to the HTML file(if that is what I'm supposed to do...)

## Anything Blocking?
> FOCS exam next week will take a lot of my time over the last few days of the week. Will try to delve more into RCOS work before then!

## Notes 
> None
