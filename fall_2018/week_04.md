## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Finished developing the website wireframe. All essential websites (splash page, all petitions, etc) currently have a visual draft.

## This Week's Plan
> Work on basic functionality of the site (permissions of people who are logged in/not logged (through databases?), etc), essentially backend tasks.

## Anything Blocking?
> Have a quiz this Thursday, and general workload and time management issues (must fix!).

## Notes 
> None
