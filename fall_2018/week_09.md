## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Nothing in terms of the project, unfortunately. Enjoyed a _much_ needed break during Thanksgiving.
>

## This Week's Plan
> **Actually** delve more into connecting a 'database' to the frontend.
> 
> Once that's out of the way, make the paginations work with the data (when I get said data)

## Anything Blocking?
> Have 2 exams next Tuesday that I'm unconfident about 

## Notes 
> The reason as to why my contributions to the site have been smaller than I had hoped is that I'm taking 4 other courses along with RCOS.
