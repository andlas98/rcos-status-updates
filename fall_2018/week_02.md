## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I installed Django, pip, and virtualenv. They work without a hitch when I am in the petitions rewrite folder. 
> I have been reading through Django documentation, slowly but surely understanding the syntax. Its akin to Python, but slightly different, so theres a degree of re-education when it comes to learning the language

## This Week's Plan

> I have been assigned with designing the website on a visual level. Grace (mentor) and some others recommend I use a wireframing tool to get it done. I plan to use GIMP (Photoshop clone) to make some static screens of the new website before I do that, however. Hopefully by Saturday, I can get that done.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have no knowledge of wireframing for web design until now. Not necessarily a worry; dont have to worry about it until I get those static images done.

## Notes

None
