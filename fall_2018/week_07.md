## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Added a wiki page to the repository about the website wireframes: https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/wiki/Website-Wireframes
> 
> Created a branch called _'frontend'_, which contains a new folder with the front-end code I've created so far: https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/tree/frontend. Click the _'webpages'_ folder to see the files I'm working on! 
>
> Added a very basic pagination tab, _'Resolved'_ and _'Recognized'_ checkboxes, and a 'Sort By' dropdown overlay. None of these are functional (none of the buttons do anything, save for the dropdown, which drops down lol)

## This Week's Plan
> Commit more and more!
> 
> Find out how to connect past petitions to the page! Guess I have to connect to a database?
> 
> Add functionality to some of the objects (might need to know how to add actual petitions to the page before I can do that)
>
> Continue working on the all petitions page

## Anything Blocking?
> FOCS Exam tomorrow, and an out-of-state conference from Thursday to Sunday afternoon, so I might not be able to add more to this for next week

## Notes 
> None
