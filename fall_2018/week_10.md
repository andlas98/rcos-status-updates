## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Not much really; I managed to communicate with the person who's working on the new website's database. He is still trying to find out how to make it work. Therefore, I can't do much in terms of connecting databases, other than learning Django in order to help him out, which I am not against doing.

## This Week's Plan
> Create a 'layout' for the petitions, learn on how to 'show' a certain amount of petitions per page (maybe). While that last part might be a little extra, it _could_ come in handy after the database is finished and properly implemented.

## Anything Blocking?
> EXAMS! I have 2 on Tuesday this week (DiffEq, Physics1), but after that I should be pretty free to search up and work on other courses (especially RCOS!).

## Notes 
> While I am a bit curious about the database's construction, there's very little time to really dig in to it, what with coursework and finals around the corner.
