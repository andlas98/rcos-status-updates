## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Created a 'Create a Petition' webpage. It currently has a Submit button and input groups for the petition's name and description.
> 
> You can input your name and description, but nothing can be saved, as the database hasn't been implemented yet.

## This Week's Plan
> Study for finals and go home!
> 
> Have a technical examination to take in the next 3 days, so I'll have to take care of that before Finals!

## Anything Blocking?
> Nope

## Notes 
> RCOS was one of the more enjoyable courses this semester. I've already registered for its Spring iteration.
